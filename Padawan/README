PADAWAN - PHP AST-based Detection of Antipatterns, Workarounds And general Nuisances
(c) 2007-2009 Mayflower GmbH, http://www.mayflower.de

Padawan checks php code for code smells that indicate sloppy code, common mistakes and programming antipatterns.

This works by generating an abstract syntax tree representation of the php code in xml
with the help of phpcompiler, then searching for patterns inside those xml files via xpath.

Requirements:
* PHP 5.2.2+ with SimpleXML (5.2.2 changed DirectoryIterator behaviour)
* phpcompiler 0.2.0.3 (http://www.phpcompiler.org)

Usage:
- install phpcompiler
- edit padawan.config.php.dist - especially if "$ which phc" fails
  and rename it to padawan.config.php
- run "$ ./padawan.php -c <source> <target>" to create the AST files
- run "$ ./padawan.php -p <dir or file>"

- run "$ ./padawan.php -h" for help
